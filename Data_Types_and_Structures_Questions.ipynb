        "#Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, and storing data in a computer. They help in efficiently managing and retrieving data, and\n",
        "#they define the relationship between different data elements. In essence, they are ways to structure data so that it can be used and manipulated effectively\n",

        "#2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n",
        "#1. Mutable Data Types:\n",
        "#Mutable data types are those whose values or contents can be changed after the object is created. In other words, once an object of a mutable data type is created,\n",
        "#its state can be modified without creating a new object.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Examples of mutable data types:\n",
        "#Lists in Python\n",

        "#Arrays (in some languages)\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. Immutable Data Types:\n",
        "#Immutable data types, on the other hand, cannot be changed once they are created. Any operation that attempts to modify the object will result in the creation of a new object,\n",
        "#leaving the original object unchanged.\n",

        "#In Python, both lists and tuples are used to store collections of data. However, there are several key differences between them that affect how and when each should be used.\n",
        "#Here’s a breakdown of the main differences between lists and tuples in Python 3:\n",
        "\n",
        "#List: Mutable — You can modify the contents of a list after it’s created. You can add, remove, or change elements.\n",

        "#4- Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "#In Python, dictionaries are a type of associative array or hash map, where data is stored as key-value pairs.\n",

        "#5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python3\n",
        "# You might use a set instead of a list in Python when you need to store unique elements and eliminate duplicates automatically.\n",
        "#Sets provide faster membership testing (O(1) time complexity), support set operations like union and intersection, and are more memory efficient.\n",
        "#However, sets are unordered and do not support indexing, unlike lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#6.What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list3\n",
        "# A string in Python is an immutable sequence of characters used to represent text. Unlike a list, which can\n",
        "#hold multiple types of elements and is mutable, a string is immutable, meaning its contents cannot be\n",
        "#changed after creation. Strings are indexed by characters, while lists can store any data type and support operations like adding, removing, or modifying elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "#7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "#Tuples ensure data integrity in Python by being immutable, meaning once created, their contents cannot be\n",
        "#modified. This prevents accidental changes to data, ensuring that the tuple's values remain constant\n",
        "#throughout the program. As a result, tuples are ideal for storing fixed data, like coordinates or configurations, where data integrity is crucial.\n",
